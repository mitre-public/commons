/**
 * A MetricSet is a data-structure designed to efficiently support k-nearest-neighbor (kNN)
 * searches, range searches, as well as regular add/remove operations. To support kNN searches a
 * MetricSet requires a DistanceMetric that defines the distance between any two keys. The
 * DistanceMetric should define a Metric Space (in the strict algebraic sense) in which the
 * following four assumptions are true:
 * <p>
 * {@code
 *    (1) d(x,y) >= 0
 *    (2) d(x,y) = d(y,x)
 *    (3) d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)
 *    (4) d(x , y ) = 0 if and only
 *    if x = y (optional)
 * }
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A MetricSet is loosely based on the MTree introduced by Paolo Ciaccia, Marco Patella, and Pavel
 * Zezula in 1997 in the paper "M-tree An Efficient Access Method for Similarity Search in Metric
 * Spaces" from the Proceedings of the 23rd VLDB Conference.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A MetricSet is a binary search tree in which each node in the tree owns a multi-dimensional
 * sphere. That sphere's radius is large enough to ensure that every Key beneath that node is
 * located inside that node's sphere. Therefore, the root node of an MetricSet has a large radius
 * because every Key contained in the MetricSet must fit inside its sphere. Sub-trees are associated
 * with smaller spheres. Each sphere has a centerpoint and radius whose values are used to route
 * adds, kNN searches, and range searches.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * When Keys are first added to a MetricSet they are placed inside a "Sphere of Points". Eventually,
 * that Sphere will need to be split because it will have too many entries to search quickly. When
 * this occurs the original "Sphere of Points" becomes a "Sphere of Spheres" that owns 2 newly
 * created "Sphere of Points". Together the 2 new "Sphere of Points" will contain all the Key+Value
 * pairs that the original overfilled "Sphere of Points" contained. The centerpoints of the 2 new
 * "Sphere of Points" are selected to reduce the overlapping volume between the 2 new spheres.
 * Reducing this shared volume reduces the number of spheres a search must visit.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * When Keys are removed from a MetricSet they are correctly removed, however, the fact that the key
 * was present in the MetricSet may leave a permanent imprint on the MetricSet. This occurs when the
 * Key was selected as the centerpoint for a "Sphere of Points". In this case the Key is still used
 * to route add operations and queries even though the Key is no longer contained in the tree. Any
 * insertion of a Key can permanently reduce the query routing efficency of an MetricSet. This
 * occurs when the key insertion forces a Sphere to increase its radius (which will not shrink upon
 * key removal).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * It is important to know that MetricSets have no automatic balancing mechanism. Therefore
 * inserting Key pairs where the Keys vary in some predictable way is likely to produce a tree that
 * is unbalanced. In principal, tree balance could be maintained by rotating the Sphere nodes
 * similar to how AVL and Red-Black trees rotate nodes to maintain balance. The makeBalancedCopy()
 * and rebalance() methods are provided to combat tree imbalance, but these method are expensive and
 * should be used sparingly if possible. These methods rebuild the tree from scratch by adding the
 * existing Keys (which may exhibit some amount of imbalance) back into the tree in a random order
 * (which will limit the tree's imbalance IMMEDIATELY AFTER the rebuild).
 * <p>
 *
 * @param <K> The Keys, these keys are stored in HashMaps, so their hashcode() and equals() methods
 *            must be defined correctly.
