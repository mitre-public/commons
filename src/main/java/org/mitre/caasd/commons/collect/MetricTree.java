/**
 * A MetricTree is a Map-like data-structure designed to efficiently support k-nearest-neighbor
 * (kNN) searches, range searches, as well as regular Map style put/get operations. To support kNN
 * searches a MetricTree requires a DistanceMetric that defines the distance between any two keys.
 * The DistanceMetric should define a Metric Space (in the strict algebraic sense) in which the
 * following four assumptions are true:
 * <p>
 * {@code
 *    (1) d(x,y) >= 0
 *    (2) d(x,y) = d(y,x)
 *    (3) d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)
 *    (4) d(x , y ) = 0 if and only
 *    if x = y (optional)
 * }
 * <p>
 * A MetricTree is loosely based on the MTree introduced by Paolo Ciaccia, Marco Patella, and Pavel
 * Zezula in 1997 in the paper "M-tree An Efficient Access Method for Similarity Search in Metric
 * Spaces" from the Proceedings of the 23rd VLDB Conference.
 * <p>
 * A MetricTree is a binary search tree in which each node in the tree owns a multi-dimensional
 * sphere. That sphere's radius is large enough to ensure that every Key beneath that node is
 * located inside that node's sphere. Therefore, the root node of an MetricTree has a large radius
 * because every Key contained in the MetricTree must fit inside its sphere. Sub-trees are
 * associated with smaller spheres. Each sphere has a centerpoint and radius whose values are used
 * to route put/get requests, kNN searches, and range searches.
 * <p>
 * When Keys are first added to a MetricTree they are placed inside a "Sphere of Points".
 * Eventually, that Sphere will need to be split because it will have too many entries to search
 * quickly. When this occurs the original "Sphere of Points" becomes a "Sphere of Spheres" that owns
 * 2 newly created "Sphere of Points". Together the 2 new "Sphere of Points" will contain all the
 * Key+Value pairs that the original overfilled "Sphere of Points" contained. The centerpoints of
 * the 2 new "Sphere of Points" are selected to reduce the overlapping volume between the 2 new
 * spheres. Reducing this shared volume reduces the number of spheres a search must visit.
 * <p>
 * When Key+Value pairs are removed from a MetricTree they are removed, however, the fact that the
 * key was present in the MetricTree may leave a permanent imprint on the MetricTree. This occurs
 * when the Key was selected as the centerpoint for a "Sphere of Points". In this case the Key is
 * still used to route get/put queries even though the Key is no longer associated with a Key+Value
 * pair. Any insertion of a Key can permanently reduce the query routing efficency of an MetricTree.
 * This occurs when the key insertion forces a Sphere to increase its radius (which will not shrink
 * upon key removal).
 * <p>
 * It is important to know that MetricTrees have no automatic balancing mechanism. Therefore
 * inserting Key+Value pairs where the Keys vary in some predictable way is likely to produce a tree
 * that is unbalanced. In principal, tree balance could be maintained by rotating the Sphere nodes
 * similar to how AVL and Red-Black trees rotate nodes to maintain balance. The makeBalancedCopy()
 * and rebalance() methods are provided to combat tree imbalance, but these method are expensive and
 * should be used sparingly if possible. These methods rebuild the tree from scratch by adding the
 * existing Key + Value pairs (which may exhibit some amount of imbalance) back into the tree in a
 * random order (which will limit the tree's imbalance IMMEDIATELY AFTER the rebuild).
 * <p>
 * A MetricTree is "fast" because the Binary Tree structure discussed above is paired with a
 * standard HashMap that contains all of the Key + Value Pairs. This means replacing the value
 * associated with a "preexisting" key, removing a Key + Value pair, and getting a key does not
 * require a tree traversal or computing the DistanceMetric.
 *
 * @param <K> The Keys, these keys are stored in HashMaps, so their hashcode() and equals() methods
 *            must be defined correctly.
 * @param <V> The Values
