/**
 * An OutputSink is a "place" where output data can be sent (frequently for permanently storage)
 * <p>
 * This interface has two goals.
 * <p>
 * The first goal is to allow client code to easily "plug-in" the output publication rules of their
 * choice. For example, client code may want to publish records to a Database, a Kafka Cluster, an
 * Avro archive, or merely print them to a text file or System.out. In any case, the code that
 * creates records should be cleanly separated from the code that publishes/archives those records.
 * <p>
 * The second goal is to make client code more readable. The term OutputSink is easier to understand
 * than a "Consumer<T>"
