/**
 * An ErrorCatchingTask is a Decorator that passes Exceptions thrown by a Runnable's run() method to
 * a dedicated ExceptionHandler. Any Errors thrown by the Runnable are caught, provided to the
 * ErrorHandlingPolicy, and then rethrown.
 * <p>
 * ErrorCatchingTask is intended to:
 * <p>
 * (1) Make it easy to combine pre-built "Error Handling logic" and pre-built "Task logic" into a
 * single "Task with well understood error handling".
 * <p>
 * (2) Provide a better way to handle Exceptions and Errors that cause confusing behavior in
 * ExecutorServices. The issue with ExecutorServices is that the Runnable objects executed within
 * them can fail silently unless you (A) use an exception trapping mechanism (like this class) or
 * you (B) actively inspect the {@code Future} objects returned when the Runnables were added to the
 * Executor in the first place. Manually inspecting these {@code Futures} is a MUCH more complicated
 * approach because properly interacting with them is in itself a multi-threaded problem that can
 * lead to unintended thread deadlocks.
