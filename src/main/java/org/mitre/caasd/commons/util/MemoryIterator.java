/**
 * A MemoryIterator is an Iterator that has been augmented to make it easy to access two consecutive
 * elements in the iteration.
 * <p>
 * For example, say you want to compute the difference between two consecutive elements in a list of
 * numbers. Doing this careful requires handling 4 separate cases. Case 1: you are at the front of
 * the sequence and you do not have a "prior" element to compute a different. Case 2: you are in the
 * middle of the sequence and there is a "current" and "prior" element so computing a difference is
 * possible. Case 3: you are at the end of the sequence and you cannot compute a difference because
 * you do not have a "next" element. Case 4: the sequence contained no data whatsoever.
 * <p>
 * It is annoying, and error-prone, to correctly keep track of this state manually. Loops built
 * using manual consecutive element tracking are difficult to read because the important code is
 * occluded with basic housekeeping code. A MemoryIterator improves code clarity, and reliability,
 * because the basic housekeeping is done for you.
 * <p>
 * Note: This class is similar in spirit to Guava's PeekingIterator. That class provides easy access
 * to the next element via calls to "peek()". Whereas this class provides easy access to the last
 * element via calls to "prior()". This class also adds the methods "atFront()", "inMiddle()",
 * "atEnd()", and "isEmpty()".
 *
 * This class is Deprecated in favor of NeighborIterator
